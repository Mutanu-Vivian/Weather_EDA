# Weather Pattern Analysis

## Project Overview

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis project on a Weather Dataset, examining the different weather variables that contribute to establishing a distinct Weather Condition.  

## Observed Patterns

This analysis has identified the following seasonal patterns, with changes occuring every Four months, with the pattern repeating itself every January(Start of he cycle).  
From the observations, the distinct seasons are:  
  1. **Low Levels** (January to April)
  2. **Rising Levels** (May to September)
  3. **Decreasing Levels** (October to December)  

## Key Findings

- Clear correlation between Temperature and Dew Point variables
- Consistent annual cycle with three distinct phases
- Potential for predictive modeling based on these patterns

## Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python (Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy)
